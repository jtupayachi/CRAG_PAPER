This paper presents an approach that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with domain-specific knowledge to enhance question-answering, particularly in Geographic Information System (GIS) data. By leveraging external databases through a REST API, the framework integrates API documentation and user queries to provide specialized responses.

The CRAG (Continuous RAG) approach iteratively refines and updates the information in the vector database to improve the accuracy and relevance of responses, allowing for dynamic, flexible adaptation to new information.

This approach reduces the need for extensive fine-tuning by maintaining generalizable instructions for different endpoints, enhancing adaptability while optimizing resource efficiency.
